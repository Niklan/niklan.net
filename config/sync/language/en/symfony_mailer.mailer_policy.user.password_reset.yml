        <p>A request has been made to reset the password for your account at <a href="[site:url]">[site:name]</a>.
        You may now use this link to <a href="[user:one-time-login-url]">log in</a>.
        This link can only be used once to log in and will lead you to a page where you can set your password. It expires after one day and nothing will happen if it's not used.</p>
