## Quality tools

The project uses PHPCS and PHPStan for checkin quality of the code and code-style.

### PHPCS

PHPCS is configured in [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml). It uses Drupal PHPCS rules with additional one from [chi-teck/drupal-coder-extension](https://github.com/Chi-teck/drupal-coder-extension) package for modern PHP syntax improvements.

**Run PHPCS:**

```shell
composer phpcs
```

### PHPStan

PHPStan is configured in [phpstan.neon](phpstan.neon). It uses [mglaman/phpstan-drupal](https://github.com/mglaman/phpstan-drupal) on top of default ones. Currently, it is on level 1, because level 2 requires changes in Drupal core directly.

**Run PHPStan:**

```shell
composer phpstan
```

## Testing

The project is uses PHPUnit for testing its codebase.

### PHPUnit

PHPUnit is extended with [weitzman/drupal-test-traits](https://gitlab.com/weitzman/drupal-test-traits) for some ¬´existing site¬ª testing.

**Run PHPUnit:**

```shell
composer phpunit
```

**Run PHPUnit from Docker 4 Drupal containers:** (see [d4d-php.sh](scripts/d4d-php.sh) for explanation)

```shell
composer d4d-phpunit
```
