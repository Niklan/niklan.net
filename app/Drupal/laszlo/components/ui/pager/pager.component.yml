name: Pager
description: >
  This component provides additional features for loading more contents from the
  next page. The URL for fetching is set automatically from the pager data, but
  additional settings should be specified somewhere in the parent elements. As
  long as these settings are found, the "Load more" button is displayed;
  otherwise, it is hidden.

  The settings should be in the `data-load-more-settings` attribute with JSON
  data, containing `append` and/or `replace` values. Each of these values is an
  array, keyed by CSS selector for elements on the fetched page (next page) and
  the CSS selector on the current page to perform the operation.
  
  For example:
  @code
  {
    "append": {".article-list .article": ".article-list"},
    "replace": {".article-list__pager": ".article-list__pager"},
  }
  @endcode
  
  In the given example, "append" will search for ".article-list .article"
  elements on the fetched page and append them to ".article-list". "Replace"
  will basically replace existing elements with the newer ones.
  
  At least one append or replace rule should be provided, otherwise the "Load
  more" button will not be shown.
