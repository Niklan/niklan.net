            I got interested in web development in 2006, when I got into a camp with a computer bias, where there was a group for creating simple HTML pages. I also created <a href="{{ repository_url }}" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">first HTML site</a>. Since then, I started to get involved in this direction by making simple websites for myself and trying different CMS.

            In 2011 I started to study Drupal and PHP, and since 2013 I have been doing it professionally. Since then I have been providing web development services remotely from Perm.

            I use Drupal exclusively in my work. I think it's better to know one tool well than many and mediocre. I put the work quality on the first place, I'm concerned about the standards, I constantly study the best practices and experiences of other developers, I monitor the trends and changes in the web. I'm constantly engaged in self-study.
